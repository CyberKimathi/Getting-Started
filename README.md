## Things to Know before starting a journey in cybersecurity

1.Cybersecurity is **NOT** easy(might be simple, but never easy).

2.Cybersecurity requires:
* Persistence
* Patience
* Dedication
* Lots of reading and researching
* Lots of practice
* Eagerness to dig into technical questions and examine them from all sides.
* Enthusiasm and a high degree of adaptability.
* An understanding of how systems work.

3.The following skills are essential as far as cybersecurity training is concerned:

* Basic knowledge of operating systems: Since you will work with various operating systems, understanding architecture, and use of operating systems is paramount.

* Knowledge of programming: Understanding programming languages including C/C++, Java or other scripting languages like Python and PHP gives you an added edge over the other security professionals.
    
* Computer networking basics: Understanding network protocols such as IP Addressing, subnetting, and how they work will help you in natural learning of cybersecurity.
    
* Web application technologies: A sound exposure in these applications and how they work will be a great asset in helping you learn cybersecurity.

4.Taking notes is very important in cybersecurity and comes in handly. Below are some of the methods I recommend for note taking
* [Github - My example notes](/example-notes.md)
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
* [Osidian](https://obsidian.md/)
* [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)


## Things to learn
CyberSecurity will require one to interact with various operating systems. The most recommended operating system recommended while working in cybersecurity is Linux. This is because Linux is open-source (free) and many cybersecurity tools are build for the linux operating system. There are many linux distributions for cybersecurity enthusiasts, but here we will choose Kali Linux since it is the most popular one

### Installing kali linux
Choose one from the below methods of installing kali linux

## Cybersecurity Categories
With time, you will need to pick an area in cybersecurity to specialize in. Below are some of the most common categories in cybersecurity that one may choose from
```
Binary exploitation
Reverse engineering
Web exploitation
Cryptography/Digital security
Network and cloud Security
Forensics 
Steganography
Red Teaming(Active Directory etc.)
Hardware Hacking
```
- [Cybersecurity categories in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI79qT4lcfA)

### Choosing another programming language depending on the cybersecurity category to pursue
```
Binary exploitation - python,c,c++,assembly
Reverse engineering - python,c,c++,java,assembly etc
Web exploitation - python,php,javascript,mysql,html,css
Cryptography - python
Network Security - python
Forensics(Disk,memory,etc)  - python
Steganography - python
```

## CTFs
Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. It can either be for competitive or educational purposes.

The best way to learn how to hack is to do it. There are several practice sites and capture-the-flag exercises to teach you how to break security.
